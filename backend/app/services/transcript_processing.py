        Merge segments with short pauses to create coherent phrases.

        Addresses fragmented speech where natural pauses within a single
        thought cause unnecessary segment splits.

        Examples:
            - "Жалобы на" + "кашель" + "температуру" → "Жалобы на кашель, температуру"
            - "Назначаю" + "антибиотик" + "амоксициллин" → "Назначаю антибиотик амоксициллин"

        Based on analysis of real medical consultations:
            - ~57.5% of pauses are <0.8s (natural speech rhythm)
